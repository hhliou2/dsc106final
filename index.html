      In MMA and some other sports, a southpaw stance is where the athlete's posture is mirrored compared to the norm; for our case, the fighter has their right hand and right foot forward. Left-handed fighters are usually more comfortable in a southpaw stance, but right-handed fighters can also fight in the southpaw stance for many reasons. Fighting in a southpaw stance is believed to give the fighter a strategic advantage because of the tactical and cognitive difficulties of coping with a fighter who moves in a mirror-reverse of the norm.<br /><br />

      Through this project, we wanted to explore and analyze the performance of Southpaw fighters compared to Orthodox fighters.

  How many fighters in the UFC actually utilize the Southpaw Stance? While the difference between Orthodox and Southpaw fighters may seem jarring, there is actually a significantly large portion of Southpaw fighters. In fact, they make up two times what we would expect for a group of left-handed fighters. This, indeed, reflects the reality; a significant portion of fighters feel that switching their stance will give them an edge in a fight.

  So, are these experimental fighters really maximizing their potential with this jarring change in technique?<br /><br />

  We have quantified “advantages” in our graphs based on a combination of the height, weight, and reach advantage one fighter has over the other. Generally, fighters on the red corner are the better fighter, championing both their seniority and their strong stats. The blue corner, as such, is always the underdog challenger. Nonetheless, the body composition of each fighter remains relatively even.

  Thus, we need a new angle to phrase our question. Can Southpaw challengers (blue corner) bridge the gap that Orthodox fighters can’t, and can Southpaw champions (red corner) keep orthodox challengers at bay more efficiently? <br /><br />

  To find out, we've compared the win rates of each type of matchup (Southpaw v. Orthodox, Southpaw v. Southpaw, Orthodox v. Orthodox) to see if there really is any particular difference in results. These win rates are further separated into advantage, disadvantage, and equal advantage to see if the stance difference can really widen or close the gap compared to our control groups. <br /><br />

  The percentages for each group, however, are almost perfectly copied. There is no significantly observable difference between a Southpaw v. Orthodox fight and any other matchup.

<br /><br /><br /><br />
So what ended up happening with all the talk about the Southpaw advantage? Was it all a big misconception? Perhaps, people learned to counter the Southpaw matchup over time. Thus, of the Southpaw-Orthodox matchups, we charted Southpaw win percentages to see if there was a decline. And indeed there was, although we could not use earlier years due to an underrepresentation of Southpaws in MMA.

<p>
<br /><br /><br /><br />
So, should fighters stop using the Southpaw stance? Not exactly. By purely a measure of personal preference, the Southpaw stance can feel more natural for a left-handed or left-dominant fighter. However, a fighter should not feel pressured to switch stances off the merit of someone telling him that Southpaws do better.
